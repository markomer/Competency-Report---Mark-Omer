        - a little bit about myself -
    </p>
    <p class="blue-bg text">My name is Mark Omer, born through mostly Swedish ancestry - three of my grandparents were Swedish natives. I am very proud to be an American, but I am also very proud of who my forebears were and <del>where they came from</del> from whence they came.</p>
    
    <p class="green-bg">Throughout my military career, which spanned over 27 years, I mostly worked as a <i>linguist.</i> I learned <b>Japanese, Polish and Mandarin Chinese</b> though rarely used these languages directly. Since I retired from the military I have been an artist and art teacher. I have taught <mark class="highlight-bg">in my studio, at a high school and at a community college</mark>. I am very excited for this current opportunity to learn about software development, and hope to implement this new skill into freelance work.</p>
